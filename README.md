# SSIM_PSNR_Metrics
"To understand how well a super-resolution method performs, you can use two popular metrics: SSIM and PSNR. Here is a file to obtain two images with the same width and height from you'r device and calculate the values of these two metrics. Be careful about the value of 'win_size' in 'ssim_value,' which should be an odd number and have a value less than the width and height of the images. Another important thing is that these two values are calculated on one channel of the image (if it has three channels), and you can change the channel in this part of the code: 'Convert to numpy arrays for SSIM and PSNR calculation.
To understand how well a model works, you can observe SSIM and PSNR. A higher PSNR and a SSIM closer to 1 indicate better performance.
